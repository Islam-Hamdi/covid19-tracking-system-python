# COVID-19 Tracking System 🦠📊

This project was developed as part of the **CMPS151 - Programming Concepts** course at Qatar University. It represents a complete console-based application to track and analyze COVID-19 data using Python.

## 📌 Project Overview

The system allows users to:
- Add new country records (cases, deaths, etc.)
- Display all countries' COVID-19 statistics in a formatted table
- Search for specific countries by their code
- Generate filtered reports based on case thresholds
- Classify countries into severity levels
- Visualize the data with a dynamic bar chart

This project demonstrates file handling, data processing, conditionals, loops, functions, modularity, and simple data visualization using `matplotlib`.

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Text file-based data storage
- 🖥️ Console interaction with color-coded outputs
- 📊 Matplotlib bar chart showing total cases per country
- ✅ Classification system (Severely/Moderately/Less Affected)
- 🔍 Search and filter capabilities

## 📂 Files Included

- `covid19_tracking_system.py`: Main application script
- `functions.py`: All modular function definitions
- `covid19_information.txt`: Initial dataset of countries and cases

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (for charts)
- Basic terminal formatting (ANSI escape codes)
